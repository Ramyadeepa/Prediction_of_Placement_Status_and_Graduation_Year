# Prediction_of_Placement_Status_and_Graduation_Year

PROBLEM:

To make the most of available resources provide timely support and guarantee excellent academic and career outcomes it is crucial to know when the student will graduate and whether they will receive a placement.

BACKGROUND:

(EVIDENCE TO DESCRIBE AND EXPLAIN THE CONTEXT OF THE PROBLEM)
Lack of clear academic planning and career advice is the root cause of the issue with students not knowing when they will graduate and not receive a placement. Students may have trouble finishing their coursework on time if they don't receive timely information on their graduation status. Furthermore, individuals could not be well prepared for the job market without a prior understanding of the placement-specific skills which could make it harder for them to get employment and harm their prospects for successful careers in general

RELEVANCE:

(DESCRIPTION OF WHY THE PROBLEM MATTERS)
This issue is important because it has a direct impact on student's academic performance and future work prospect resulting in postponed graduation; unemployment, and restricted professional and development

OBJECTIVE:

(PROPOSED SOLUTIONS TO THE PROBLEM BASED ON RESEARCH AND UNDERSTANDING)
The solution involves developing predictive model for student placement and calculation for year of graduation which accurately forecasts whether students secure placement and when students will graduate.
1. The year of graduation calculation will function by utilizing essential features and historical data. A dataset containing data on student's college details including college name, academic year and branch will be used.
2. Student placement prediction will function by utilizing essential features and historical data. A dataset containing data on student's academic records, course progress, extracurricular activities, and previous placement results will be used to train the machine learning system. In order for the model to accurately forecast whether students secure placement. It must learn pattern and correlations from this data.
